### Architecture

        Person(customerA, "Inditex employee", "Unprivileged user")
      }

      Boundary(b3, "Internet", "publicly available") {

      }

      Enterprise_Boundary(b4, "Cloud") {

        System(SystemA, "Inditex Tech Management", "Allows users to read monitoring data and configure services. Administrators can manage services under technical incidents")


        SystemDb(SystemB, "Inditex Tech Management Database", "A system of the bank, with personal bank accounts.")

### Assumptions
* Corporate employees use corporate secure laptops to access the application
* The system administrators are subcontracted to a supplier company. They need to have access to the application from Internet
* We cannot protect against threats on the laptops of the suppliers, but we have a contract that protects us
* The supplier company uses only one user account to access the application, which it shares among its employees
* We cannot rotate the password due to the risk of leaving the supplier company without access
* TLS is an adequate mitigation for threats related to tampering and information disclosure of data in transit over the network
* The database is only accessible by the application, and does not contain sensitive information 
* Programmers follow secure development best practices and the corporate software lifecycle

### Threats

* **T1:** An internet-based threat actor without user permissions can use known exploits to attack vulnerabilities in the application which leads to the integrity of the system compromised, negatively impacting business operations

* **T2:** A dissatisfied employee who has normal access can tamper services configuration data which leads to hange the normal operation of services, negatively impacting the services to which they have access

* **T3:** An internet-based threat actor with access to a supplier account credentials can spoof an administrator which leads to stop corporate services, negatively impacting the entire company: sales services, logistics, manufacturing, ...

### Controls

|  Control | Mitigated Threat  | Implemented  | Notes  |
|---|---|---|---|
| C1: Employ automated patch management tools to facilitate flaw remediation to the following system components  | T1  | Yes  |   |
| C1: Protect application using WAF and bot services   | T1  | Yes  |   |
| C2: Log user actions in the application: user, date and time, action performed  | T2  | Yes  |  Logs are deleted every 3 months |
| C3: Provide a different user account per administrator of the supplier company (current format: _srvc_adm\<name\>_)  |  T3 | No  |  Planned for next year |
| C3: Enable 2FA and rotate administrator passwords |  T3 | No  |  Unplanned  |
